so you habve some stats whcih need to be managed, removing cards/adding cards affects these stats

at the end of each turn, each card on the board exhibits some simple behavior, 
then cards are added to the board

you need to manage both your stats and also the board

OKSOUNDSGOOD

behaviors v5:
	circle: 
		gains 1 for each neighboring circle, 
		grows whereever available. 
	spiral: 
		switches spots and values with a non spiral card, or generates one spiral
		turns cicles into V's and vice versa
	V: 
		turns a nearby card of lesser value into a V (new card val = cur card.value - lesser value card.value), otherwise fizzles out.
		loses 1
	factory: 
		turns circles into factories, otherwise destroys a neighbor 
		suffocates if surrounded by any single type of tile


create a function to send the positions of the cards back to the main table, clear the table after each turn then take that as the new input
OKO

alright i got lost with all the signals

make a flow chart for order of ops

current bug: i want to make it so that you can only combine neighbor cards, but that isnt working. fix pls.



game idea update:
cards take their turn when you combine them or when you select them

new rules:
Circles: bolsters each neighbor
Spirals: switch symbol with the target
Vectors: destroy a neighbor, 
Factories



alright so you have 3 turns to prevent the factories from destorying any nearby cells

on your turn you have the following actions:
	moving cards
	combining cards
	activating cards

moving cards:
	cards can be moved one tile at a time
combining cards:
	cards of the same suit can be combined
	when theyre combined, their action triggers
activating cards:
	cards can be triggered by having them interact with a nearby card of a different suit


triggers:
	green:
		give +1
		loses 1
	blue:
		swap suit/value
	red:
		turns card into a red with value of red.val - card.val



have spirals rotate each card when triggered? and the goal is to get the factories to destory eachother?
cards have two triggers, one when combined, one when swapped
swapped:
	spirals switch suit
	circles add value
	vectors remove value
	
combined
	spirals rotate every nearby card
	circles draw $value cards
	vectors deal $value damage to factories



ALL OF YOUR WOES ARE CAUSED BY THis:
when dropping a card, if there is another card in that spot and the turn isnt valid, that card is being picked up
because of that, its location is listed as empty and its floating above the other cards
